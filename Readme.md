## Trivia Night Creator
**Synopsis:**  You and your friends belong to a group that needs to raise money.  You agree that sponsoring a trivia night would be the best way to raise the funds and have fun doing it.  Since you have a technical background, you have offered to put together the slides for the trivia night, if all of the others will each work on a question category.  Since there are 11 of your, this works out to have 10 rounds with 10 questions each!  Perfect!

After you think about this for a bit, you tell them that they need to send you a document that clearly describes a question and an answer, and the file name has to match the category they are writing.  As an example, they will give you a file name "sports.txt", or "sports.docx", etc.  Inside the file, you will see something like this:

>Question: In what year was the new Busch Stadium built?

>Answer: 2006

>Question: What team has the most Superbowl wins?

>Answer: Pittsburg Steelers

You should expect to get 10 files, each with 10 questions and 10 answers in order.  You will need to produce a PowerPoint file that is the basis for this trivia night that someone will take and "doctor it up" for the final presentation.  

## How this assignment will be handled in the class
This is a large project.  It will take time to build this out, and will exercise all of the topics discussed in class.  The final result of this project is 100 points!  However, each week there will be multiple "side-assignments" that prepares the final submission.  There will be nothing demanded of you beyond that which you already know from the classwork.  There is a discussion board open for this assignment, an initial starting project in GitHub, and office hours will be open.  If you have questions, want to work out some details, or even need a push to get started, I have to know that if I'm to be of any help.  

Submissions can be resubmitted until the due date of the project.  **NO PENULTY FOR MULTIPLE TRIES!!!**

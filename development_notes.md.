Fisrt Submission for the Project.


Assignment #1
To hold the questions and answers we could use corresponding arrays.
For example element 1 if array1 will have the first question,
Element 1 in array2 will have the first answer

string questionArray[questions 1-100]
string answerArray[answers 1-100]

These will be read in from a text document and used to fill the arrays using loops to speed the process.

readline() 
while inserting into an array

Since there will be 10 files we can still use just two arrays and fill them with questions for one 
and answers for the other. The option of using 2 arrays 1 per file (making 20 total arrays) is still applicable
but seems redundant.

Since we have not learned how to output to a power point yet I will assume we will learn that method soon.
Once that is learned we will be able to output the arrays 10 questions/answers at a time for 10 rounds.

Therefore completing the project.
